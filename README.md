gReview - The Bamboo Gerrit Integration Plugin
==============================================

This plugin polls Gerrit for changes submitted to the Gerrit review system. 
When a new change is submitted, gReview will checkout the change and verify
it builds. gReview will update the Gerrit change to reflect the correct score
for a successful or unsuccessful build.

Features
========

 * Gerrit Code Review Integration.
 * GitWeb Integration.
 * Builds and Verifies Changes Submitted to Gerrit.
 * Changes are built independently in the order they are submitted.
 * Change dependencies are resolved naturally through Gerrit PatchSets.
 * Change comments automatically updated with build results.
 * Gerrit Change Display Tab available in Build Summary.
 * [All the Features Provided By Bamboo](http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/features/)

============

 * [Bamboo 4.0.1+](http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/download)
 * [Gerrit Code Review (2.4+)](http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/downloads/list)

Troubleshooting
===============

Make sure you have Gerrit setup correctly with SSH identity key generated and 
host used in the SSH connection string added to known host. Detailed instructions 
are available in the [Gerrit documentation](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/install-quick.html#usersetup).

**Note**: Some builds will still hang in native msysgit mode on Windows due to 
the following issue with the bamboo-git-plugin: [https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-11096](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-11096).
        
You can work around this issue by manually adding your hostname, used in the 
repository configuration, to the msysgit/.ssh/known_hosts file. Example:

> 127.0.0.1 ssh-rsa XXXXB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABBBBgQC699HzXHwr1H6OJeVlRo7h4r+3PY
> d0wNkqzl6EUAeU2iZjqFqQL2ZiNVqs2JrpTNadbgtXBNk9rhQIWajQZG9ZJG/OPxe+NOkbWQVev
